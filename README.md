# Smart Waste Segregator

## Introduction
The **Smart Waste Segregator** is an innovative solution designed to automate waste management by efficiently segregating waste into distinct categories. This project leverages sensors and machine learning algorithms to identify and classify waste as biodegradable, non-biodegradable, or recyclable, contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable environment.

## Features
- **Automated Waste Classification**: Uses sensors and image recognition to identify waste type.
- **Efficient Sorting Mechanism**: Automatically separates waste into appropriate bins.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Provides live data on waste levels in bins.
- **Eco-Friendly Design**: Promotes sustainable waste management practices.
- **Mobile Application Integration**: Tracks waste levels and sends notifications when bins are full.

## Components Used
- Arduino or Raspberry Pi
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- IR Sensor
- Servo Motors
- Camera Module
- Machine Learning Model for Image Classification
- Wi-Fi Module (for IoT connectivity)
- Power Supply

## Libraries Required
Ensure the following libraries are installed for Arduino:
- `IRremote`
- `LCD_I2C`
- `LiquidCrystal`
- `Servo`

## Working Principle
1. **Detection**: The waste is placed on the platform.
2. **Classification**: The camera captures the image, and the machine learning model predicts the waste type.
3. **Segregation**: Servo motors move the waste to the appropriate bin.
4. **Monitoring**: Ultrasonic sensors measure the bin levels, sending updates to the connected mobile application.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JyiaJain/smart-waste-segregator.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Connect the hardware components as per the circuit diagram.
4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage
- Place waste on the detection platform.
- Receive notifications when bins are full.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement AI for improved waste classification.
- Integrate solar power for sustainable operation.
- Expand waste data analytics for environmental insights.
